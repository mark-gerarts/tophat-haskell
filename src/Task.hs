---- Tasks ---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Tasks parametrised over a heap `h`, making use of effects `r`.
-- |
-- | **Important!**
-- | We do *not* encode this as a free monad.
-- | It is not free, because we'd like to have full control over the semantics for bind, i.e. `Step` below.
-- | This saves us from higher order interpretation,
-- | and gives us the freedom to completely control our own semantics.
-- |
-- | It can be seen best like this:
-- | We use `Sem` and its effects to *implement* its semantics,
-- | but `Task` is not an effect itself.
-- | In particular, it can't be combined with other effects,
-- | it only *needs* effects to be interpreted (denoted by `r`).
-- | I.e. `Task` is a monad on it's own right.
-- | (Although it actually isn't a monad... but that's another story.)

  Pair :: Task h a -> Task h b -> Task h (a, b)

  -- | Assertions
  Assert :: Bool -> Task h Bool
  ---- References
  -- The inner monad `m` needs to have the notion of references.
  -- These references should be `Eq` and `Typeable`,
  -- because we need to mark them dirty and match those with watched references.

  -- | Create new reference of type `t`
  Share :: (Basic t, Reflect h) => t -> Task h (Store h t)
  -- | Assign to a reference of type `t` to a given value
  Assign :: (Basic a) => a -> Store h a -> Task h ()

-- NOTE:
-- We could choose to replace `Share` and `Assign` and with a general `Lift` constructor,
-- taking an arbitrary action in the underlying monad `m`.
-- This action would then be performed during normalisation.
-- However, for now, we like to constrain the actions one can perform in the `Task` monad.
-- This makes actions like logging to stdout, lounching missiles or other effects impossible.
-- (Though this would need to be constrained with classes when specifying the task!)
